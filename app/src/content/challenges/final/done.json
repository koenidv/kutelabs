Now it's time for you to go out there, on your own adventures.\nAs you can see, I'm also taking some time off. \n\n<br/> I'd like to leave you with some resources: \n\n - You'll recognize some of the things I've taught you and learn about many more [in the Kotlin Tour, straight from Kotlin's creators](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-welcome.html).\n- You can use Kotlin to build stuff for many platforms, you'll want to [install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for that.\n\n<br/> I wish you all the best, {{username}}. \n\n<br/> Boozle out!",
